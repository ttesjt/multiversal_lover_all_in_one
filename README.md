# Multiversal Lover â€“ Codebase Showcase.

Welcome! This is the **clean showcase version** of the _Multiversal Lover_ project, maintained until the release of the initial beta version.

## ðŸ”§ Running the Project

The frontend code is located in the `React_Frontend` folder.

To run it locally:

```bash
cd React_Frontend
npm install
npm start
```
# Project Background
This project was originally built as a Proof of Concept, aiming to validate the technical and design feasibility of the core idea. As such, we prioritized rapid development and reused existing resources where possible.

# Please note: Much of the code reflects early experimentation and does not meet my current coding standards.

The frontend was based on a chat app template by Lama Dev, available at

A full frontend remake was later initiated, but eventually paused due to underwhelming user feedback.

# My Contributions
My work on this project focused more on the backend, with some contributions to frontend features as well.

There were two versions of the backend:

Initial_Python_Version_Backend
Designed for a traditional server environment.

AWS_backend (eventually adopted)
Built for a stateless, Lambda-based serverless environment.

# Current Status
This repo reflects the beta showcase version before the planned frontend overhaul. While a frontend rework was initiated, the effort was eventually canceled due to insufficient website traffic.
